# nomad-homelab
A collection of hacks and etc. for running a homelab on Nomad.

Standard disclaimer: these are hacks that are suitable for a homelab, where it's assumed your network is 'trusted' and where
the worst thing that'll happen if you get hacked is you lose your plex library or something. Probably don't bet your company
or employer's compute capability on this, ok? #worksonmycluster

Also, I'm doing this stuff as a hobbyist - my [profile](https://log.andvari.net/about.html) suggest I'm a very impressive 
industry class hackerman, but I actually talk to people for a living and have not written more than a few lines of code for
money in close to 10 years.

However, that's only one of the reasons a lot of this stuff is janky as piss. The other reason is that I'm intentionally trying to
reinvent a few wheels here. Sure I could run microk8s with a few helm charts, but where's the fun in that? :-)
